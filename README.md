## ðŸ‘‹Hi!
I'm Wojciech, I like to make some 3D, UI/UX designs, and some programing

<!--If I had to describe myself, Iâ€™d say Iâ€™m **creative**, **funny**, and **patient**. My brain? Well, itâ€™s like a huge maze where every wall is a different idea waiting to be explored! ðŸ§©ðŸ’¡-->

I always have a ton of cool ideas for projects, and I love turning them into reality. Whether itâ€™s problem-solving, brainstorming, or just diving into a new challenge, Iâ€™m all in.

## ðŸ¦¾Skills & Strengths
- ðŸ’¬ **Communication & Teamwork:** I work great in teams, and Iâ€™m all about sharing ideas and collaborating to make projects even better.
- ðŸŒ± **Open to New Experiences:** Whether itâ€™s a new project, meeting new people, or learning something new, Iâ€™m always ready to dive in and get started

## ðŸ‘¥Letâ€™s Collaborate!
If youâ€™re interested in working together or just want to chat about new ideas, feel free to reach out! Iâ€™m always open to fun, innovative projects.
